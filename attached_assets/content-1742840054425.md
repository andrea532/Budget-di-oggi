## Description

Have you tried automated budgeting apps but failed to learn how to budget?

Can’t seem to understand why you’re still living paycheck to paycheck?

This may be because most budgeting apps don’t teach you how to budget in a way that builds accountability and responsibility in you. Other apps are automated, which makes it easy, but it also allows you to lose track of expenses when you don’t have to face your money on a daily basis.

Today’s Budget is different in that way.

Instead of offering you an automated way to manage your personal finances, it teaches you the fundamental values of truly budgeting without the distractions of automation and connections. It requires you to go back to the basics of why you should budget so that you can decide what budgeting will mean for you.

This is what Today’s Budget does. Instead of automating things where you can easily lose track of your money, Today’s Budget focuses on teaching you how to truly budget your money by creating accountability, and responsibility and building better habits that you can share with your family and friends.

Today’s Budget makes the whole budgeting process easier to learn by simplifying the process and allowing you to learn daily. Instead of being bombarded with information you don’t need or necessarily use at the moment, Today’s Budget gets you to focus on the one thing you absolutely need to know: how much you can spend that day.

If you have the motivation to change your habits and eventually change your life, Today’s Budget is the app for you.

If you prefer to automate things and connect to a bank account, this app is not for you.

Learn how to budget by going back to the basics and learning the fundamentals.

\[Today’s Budget takes your privacy seriously\]

Unlike other apps, Today’s Budget doesn’t require you to connect to your bank. It never tracks, or do we monetize your data. Any data collected is secured on your device and iCloud only.

5\. Back up your data with iCloud

• Avoid losing your info by backing up to your iCloud

6\. Personalize your experience

### Great App!! :)

> As a person who values efficiency and precision, I've found this budgeting app to be an indispensable tool in managing my finances. The user interface is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy to navigate through various features. The expense tracking feature is particularly impressive, providing a detailed breakdown of my spending habits, which has been instrumental in identifying areas for financial improvement.
>
> The budget planning feature is another standout, allowing me to set and adjust my monthly budget with ease. It's been a game-changer in helping me stay within my financial limits and avoid unnecessary expenses. The savings goals feature is also noteworthy, enabling me to set specific financial targets and track my progress towards achieving them.
>
> Overall, this app has transformed the way I manage my finances, making the process more streamlined and less stressful. It's a must-have tool for anyone looking to gain better control over their financial health.

### I bought a small iPhone just for this app

> I used the original budget and back when today’s budget was originally released, I immediately paid for lifetime. I had switched to Samsung after a time but never could find something that even came close to comparing with today’s budget (or even the original.) I was so unhappy that I purchased an iPhone SE solely just for this app. I am an avid budgeter and have tried or purchase pretty much every budgeting app out there. I do have some favorites but today’s budget for me, outshines them all. One number is all I need to see every day. I enjoy zero based budgeting. Today’s budget is my daily driver and once a week I add my expenses into a more detailed app. If the developers build something totally different in 10 years, I’ll be purchasing lifetime for that too! Privacy respected, developers who are active with their customers, the easiest budget, great UI, and does exactly what it’s supposed to do!

### Great app with lots of planned updates

> I’ve been using the Daily Budget app for a few years and purchased this one to try out the multi-budget feature. Without “continuous mode” (each month/time period resets to 0) I’ll need to use both apps for the multi-budget, which defeats the purpose of upgrading some. I did see that was listed as a planned feature and will update my review to 5 stars once that’s implemented. Other than my niche need, this is a great app and is already on-par with its predecessor. With the planned upgrades (the dev is very transparent and accessible via socials) this will be a clear upgrade. Other than continuous mode, the other upgrade I am most excited for is the ability to change wallets faster. I’m happy to have paid to support the dev while they’re putting together the updates as creating a great app like this takes money, and the 30$ is worth it in the long run. I have saved way more than 30$ or whatever I paid (it’s been awhile) using the previous app and expect to see the same benefit using this one (especially once continuous mode allows me to transition over completely).

### Developer Response ,

> \[2024-11-28\] Hi! Hope you've been well! We implemented a feature to reset the balance to zero regularly. You can reset the balance at the end of the month, every week or even every day. Here is how:

> \[2023-09-29\] Hi, hope you've been well! Hope you’ve been well! Just wanted to let you know that we implemented a in-between step to monthly reset balance feature (aka Continuous-OFF).
>
> Since v1.6, you can quickly reset your Today's Budget balance by moving it into savings with just a few taps. (Simply head to 'Add saving' > 'One-off saving') Similarly, you can easily withdraw enough to balance your negative Today's Budget back to zero. ('Withdraw' > 'Quick withdraw').
>
> It's not fully automated yet🤖 Implementing this feature to be automated is complex as it involves various scenarios, such as when to start and stop automation and handling edits to recurring expenses/income that affect past reset balances. We haven’t been able to come up with simple and transparent screens to handle these edge cases, but just wanted to let you know that there is this interim solution.

> \[2023-08-03\] Hi! Thank you so much for your thoughtful review and for being a longtime user of our apps😊🙏 Both continuous mode and easier wallet change is a popular request and we will get to them one by one, so please stay tuned! Many thanks for getting the upgrade. Developing and maintaining a great app requires resources, and we're grateful for users like you who see the value in what we do. Best, June (Co-developer)
