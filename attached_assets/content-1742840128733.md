Today's Budget

## See what you can spend each day

The app adds up your income and your outgoing regular expenses, like rent. Then it calculates what's left for you to spend each day on everything else, guilt-free.

Rollover

## Spend less today, get more for tomorrow  ‍

You get a fresh new budget every day. So, if you can come under budget today you get even more to spend tomorrow!

Budgeting becomes a fun game!

“Other budgeting methods suffer from the same fatal flaw. You set aside so much money for this and that. But it's very hard to make sure you don't spend too much and end up going over budget or running out before the end of the month. This app solves this issue by taking your budget and dividing it by all of the days in the month. You can spread out your expenses as well. Spending just a little each day so you don't run out too quickly, or saving up a little each day so you can pay cash for that new toy. Can't recommend this app enough.”

“As someone with ADHD impulse spending can be a real problem being able to track and understand my spending habits helps be be at least a little more conscious of my decisions. -I do not remember to put my items in everyday and that’s okay I just go back and put things in based on what I see for that day it’s very helpful If you have you pay intervals as well as regular bills (car payment, rent etc ect) then you actually get a daily breakdown from how much is coming in and out track how much actual spending money I have, no more overspending for me as long as I’m putting in the effort."

## About us

Hi! We're Juno and Chris. We're from Berlin and we love making apps. Ten years ago, we made our first one called "Daily Budget Original".

We see ourselves like a mom-and-pop store in a small town where the owner is at the store everyday. We talk to our users everyday and we personally answer all messages and emails. We do everything ourselves from customer communication to data model design.

Being a small team makes us – and our app – flexible and versatile, in a way big businesses cannot be.
